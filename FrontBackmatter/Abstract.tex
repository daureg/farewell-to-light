\chapter*{Abstract}
I collected check-ins from Foursquare and photos metadata from Flickr in 20
cities. After an extensive exploration of these dataset, I combined them by
extracting features to describe each cities' venues. Then I used those
features to match similar venues across cities. Results will compared again
human input gathered through a website. Finally, I plan to extend this
matching to neighborhood or whole city, subject to topology preservation and
homogeneity constraints.
