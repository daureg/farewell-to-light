\chapter*{Abstract}

We propose a method to match similar neighborhoods across different cities.
First, we collect trace of activities in 20 European and American cities from
location aware social platforms \fs{} and \flickr{}. A thorough exploration
of these datasets leads us to describe individual venues by relevant features.
% Then we learned several measure of venue similarity in a semi-supervised fashion
% and evaluate their performance on two tasks.
After gathering human ground truth, we evaluate different metrics between sets
of venues and find out that earth movers distance is the best suited at
assessing neighborhood similarity. Finally, we address the computational
efficiency problem of finding the most similar neighborhood given a query. We
devise a heuristic search strategy and show that it provides results of
comparable quality while being order of magnitude faster. Beside being useful
in touristic recommendation and urban planning, these methods apply to similar
problem setting.
