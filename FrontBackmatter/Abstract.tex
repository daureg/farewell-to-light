\chapter*{Abstract}

Large cities are made of smaller regions that serve a few primary functions.
Here we propose a method to discover such regions in a known city and to find
matching regions in a target city. Cities are seen as set of discrete venues,
described by data crawled from Foursquare and Flickr. After feature
engineering, we pick two metrics and learn their optimal parametrization. We
then devise heuristics to avoid brute force search. Beside being useful in
touristic recommendation, these methods apply to similar problem setting.

\begin{comments}
An older version:\\
I collected check-ins from Foursquare and photos metadata from Flickr in 20
cities. After an extensive exploration of these dataset, I combined them by
extracting features to describe each cities' venues. Then I used those
features to match similar venues across cities. Results will be compared
against human input gathered through a website. Finally, I plan to extend this
matching to neighborhood or whole city, subject to topology preservation and
homogeneity constraints.
