\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

I am greatly indebted to many people.

In addition to these talented and supportive people, this work would not have
been possible if not for many great open-source software. Yet because it would
feel weird to thanks them in the same place, I relegate them in the first
appendix \autoref{chap:appendix}
