\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

I am greatly indebted to many people. First to my supervisor, Prof.\@ \myProf,
for suggesting me this topic, providing me thorough and kind guidance for more
than six months, and for compensating my usual lack of enthusiasm with his.
Coming second only by alphabetical order, I also want to offer my gratitude to
my advisor, Dr.\@ \mySupervisor for his help and his fine remarks concerning my
writing\footnote{Don't get carried away, it's only a draft so you have to keep
up the good work ;)}. This research wad conducted while I was part of the
Data Mining Group\footnote{\href{http://research.ics.aalto.fi/dmg/}%
{\url{research.ics.aalto.fi/dmg/}}} and I am thankful for having met such
nice and bright people (and for having eaten many different kinds of cake
during the meetings). Actually, I may as well thank all the people I have
worked with at \myUni, because it was a real pleasure. Even more broadly, this
time in Finland was a delight, made possible as much by the vibrant surrounding
nature as by the kindness of people living there.

In addition to these talented and supportive people, this work would not have
been possible if not for many great open-source softwares. Yet because it would
feel weird to thanks them in the same place, I relegate them in the annex,
\autoref{chap:ack}.

On a personal level, I would first like to thank the members of my family for
their unconditional support. I have also heavily relied on friends for their
knowledge on Paris yet neither Camille Autran, Oliver Braud nor Aloïs Guillopé
have ever expressed any irritation (at least openly).  As I am finishing the
redaction of this manuscript, I have to acknowledge that, however frequent and
unexpected, the interruptions of Kiran Garimella were probably beneficial in
the long term. Finally, the outcome would certainly have been different without
the influence of Sanja Šćepanović; both objectively---for giving me the Twitter
key used to collect my dataset--- and subjectively---for so many reasons that
it would be pointless to try to fit them in a few sentences.
