\chapter{Introduction}
\label{ch:introduction}

Why would anyone want to find similar neighborhoods across cities in the world?
I mean, forgetting the potential insult to every culture specificity, what is
the purpose of such a task? We provide some answers related to touristic
recommendations and urban planning, but also other settings to which our
methods can be applied in \autoref{sec:motivation}. Then we formally define our
problem and introduce useful notations in \autoref{sec:problem}. Finally, those
of you that are already bored can read the one page overview of the thesis in
\autoref{sec:overview} while others may boldly proceed to
\autoref{ch:background}.
