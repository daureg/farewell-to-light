\section{Quality of results}

It's a difficult problem because the query is not clearly defined and
potentially convey high level semantics.

\section{Future work}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Apply the same method to other problems (maybe for some where the ground truth is easier to define and to obtain).
	\item Use more data sources to derive more features (for instance transportation, weather, air quality, energy consumption, demographics, etc).
	\item Learn a better ground metric, by relying more on ground truth.
	\item Automatically identify neighborhoods as dense areas sharing similar characteristics.
        \item Match several (or all) neighborhoods at the same time (but without excessive overlapping)
\end{itemize}
