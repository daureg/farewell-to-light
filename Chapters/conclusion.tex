\section{Quality of results}

It's a difficult problem because the query is not clearly defined and
potentially convey high level semantics.

\section{Future work}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Apply the same method to other problems (maybe for some where the ground truth is easier to define and to obtain).
	\item Use more data sources to derive more features (for instance transportation, weather, air quality, energy consumption, demographics, etc).
	\item Learn a better ground metric, by relying more on ground truth.
	\item Automatically identify neighborhoods as dense areas sharing similar characteristics.
        \item Match several (or all) neighborhoods at the same time (but without excessive overlapping)
	\item Deliver interpretable results. Beyond a single number, the
		similarity, or absence thereof, must be motivated. It enables
		principled comparison of cities and more user friendly output (as well
		as justifying why no sensible result were found for some queries).
		Furthermore, this would address recent concerns about Algorithmic
		Accountability \autocite{Accountability13}. For instance,
		\textcite{Discrimination13} showed that in case of online advertisement
		discrimination, opacity of the algorithms makes it difficult to find
		and sanction those responsible.

		The easiest way to do it would be to find justification after the
		matching process (by clustering venues and summarizing it like
		\enquote{These two regions match because people take a lot of photos,
		go there on weekday from 4pm to 8pm and there are a lot cultural
		buildings.} Another source of information is the resulting flow of
		EMD. Looking at what kind of venues are close between two regions also
		provide insights. Yet it would be more satisfactory if the whole
		process was driven by such considerations instead of being a mere post
		processing step.
\end{itemize}
