\begin{itemize}
	\item Collect and compute relevant features describing venues.
	\item Seamlessly incorporate heterogeneous \emph{items}.
	\item Deliver interpretable results. Beyond a single number, the
		similarity, or absence thereof, must be motivated. It enables
		principled comparison of cities and more user friendly output
		(as well as justifying why no sensible result were found for
		some queries). Furthermore, this would address recent
		concerns about Algorithmic Accountability
		\autocite{Accountability13}. For instance,
		\textcite{Discrimination13} showed that in case of online
		advertisement discrimination, opacity of the algorithms makes
		it difficult to find and sanction those responsible.
	\item Efficient search in $\mathbb{R}^2$ instead of brute force for
		the query~\ref{q:space}.
	\item Compare results with existing methods and evaluate them against
		human judging.
\end{itemize}
