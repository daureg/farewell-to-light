\begin{itemize}
	\item Collect and compute relevant features describing venues.
	\item Seamlessly incorporate heterogeneous \emph{items} by defining
		appropriate metrics and learning their parameters.
	\item Efficient search in $\mathbb{R}^2$ instead of brute force for
		the query~\ref{q:space}.
	\item Compare results with existing methods and evaluate them against
		human judging.
\end{itemize}
