\section{Exploration}
\label{sec:exploration}

While collecting these data, it was helpful to explore them, in order to
discover features that could characterize places and help cluster them into
similar groups.

\subsection{Time}

The time at which check-ins occur is undoubtedly an important variable. For
instance, \textcite{UrbanStory12} perform topic modelling from the text of
check-in tweets and show that various topics exhibit daily or weekly
patterns. Likewise, \textcite{TimeCluster13} cluster cells of a rectangular
grid according to their repartition of check-ins over categories and time of
day.

Thus we first look at when check-ins are performed through the day
\autoref{fig:daily_checkin} or the week \autoref{fig:weekly_checkin}, and how it
differs whether we consider New York, the city that never sleeps, or Helsinki.

But these patterns do not affect all venues uniformly. Taking Paris as an
example, we can summarize each venue's activity by an histogram with 3 or 4
hours bins. Then, running $k$-means algorithm with $k=5$, we obtained the
clusters depicted in \autoref{fig:day_cluster}. We observe that they have the
same characteristic shape with one peak during the day and relatively low
activity the rest of the time. We repeat these in all the cities to determine
if these clusters are universal. As showed in \autoref{fig:time_cluster_size}
\vpageref{fig:time_cluster_size}, it is the case with 4-hours bins, but
3-hours clusters exhibit slight variations across the cities of our dataset.

		evening. Yet, depending of the city, these peaks do not happen at the
		same time, nor with the same intensity. Therefore, instead of working
		directly the raw values of features, we use the number of standard
		deviation or \emph{z-score}.\label{fig:daily_checkin}}

\subsection{Space}

The other main characteristic of every check-in is where it takes place. We
focus on two spatial feature of venues. First, what does their surrounding looks
like in terms of categories repartition. For instance, if a restaurant is mainly
surrounded by night life places and another by education buildings, they
probably have customers of different kind. Second, venues are not uniformly
distributed within the city and the density of nearby locations is a
discriminative feature as well. For instance in \autoref{fig:density_paris}, we
can clearly distinguish venues belonging to the city center from the others.

	bandwidth is 50 meters and it looks too small: venue groups are isolated. In
	the bottom, $h=160$ because this value maximize the probability of
	existing venues. On the top-right, $h=350$ corresponds to parameter we
	choose to define surrounding. \label{fig:density_paris}}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Location entropy}

\Textcite{Entropy10} show that \enquote{location entropy, which measures the
diversity of unique visitors of a location} gives good indication of the
sociability level of venues and therefore help predicting friendship ties within
\gls{lbsn}.

Let $\mathcal{U}$ be the set of users and $\mathcal{V}$ the one of venues. For
each venue $v \in \mathcal{V}$, we can gather the set of check-ins $c_v$ that
occurred there as well as the corresponding users $[u_1, u_2, u_2, \ldots,
u_n]$ (note that the same users can check-in multiple times). Then we
transform this list to a frequency distribution $f_v$ over $\mathcal{U}$ and
compute the normalized entropy: \[
    H(v) = -\frac{1}{\log\left(\left| \mathcal{U}\right|\right)}
\sum_{u\in \mathcal{U}} f_v(u) \log(f_v(u)) \]

Computing this value for all venues in Paris and Barcelona demonstrates it is a
good descriptor of the \enquote{publicness} of a place. As showed in
Table \ref{tab:entropy} \vpageref{tab:entropy}, touristic attractions like the Sagrada Família or the
Eiffel Tower exhibit high entropy because they are visited by a large and
diverse set of people. On the other hand, work offices and private houses have
low entropy, as they attract a much more restricted crowd.

its relation with time entropy.\label{fig:entropies}}
\end{figure}

Following the same idea, we also computed the entropy of locations with respect
to time of check-ins. Indeed, it distinguishes between a railway station active
all day long and a restaurant open only during lunch hours.  We also expect a
link between the two entropies, as places that stay open longer have more
chance to be visited by a various set of users. But this relation, shown on
\autoref{fig:two_entropies} is weak, as some places are visited all the time by
a small group of dedicated people.



\subsection{Photos}

Finally, one interesting aspect of this dataset is the interaction between
check-ins and photos.  The spatial repartition of both objects can be seen as
an indirect signal of interest within the city. Thus we were curious to see in
which place they disagree, that is location where there are significantly more
photos taken that what we would expect by looking at the tweet concentration
(and conversely). To answer this question, we compute the discrepancy between
these two measures of activity \autocite{Agarwal2006spatial}. It turns out that
some places are mostly checked-in because events take place there (such as when
people arrive in a new city via a railway station or an airport, or when a
sport team plays a match in a stadium) whereas other are more photographed,
like museum or touristic sights.


% Look at high and low focus places: not so interesting either. High value are
% for popular places like park or monument whereas low (but not zero) are for
% mundane place (like pizzeria) close to famous locations.
