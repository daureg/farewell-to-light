\section{Closest Neighbors}

\subsection{Dimensionality reduction}

So far, t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding \autocite{tSNE08} seems
the most promising method.

\subsection{Metric learning}

After reading some surveys \autocite{MetricSurvey06, MetricSurvey13}, I tried
Information-theoretic Metric Learning \autocite{InfoMetric07} and
Gradient-Boosted Largest Margin Nearest Neighbors \autocite{GBLMNN12} although
it would be interesting to also use histogram distance
\autocite{HistogramDistance02}
