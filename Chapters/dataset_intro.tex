To solve the problem at hand, we extract information from data. Specifically,
we take of advantage of geo localized activities exposed on \fs{}
(\autoref{sec:foursquare}) and \flickr{} (\autoref{sec:flickr}). An extensive
exploration of the data collected (\autoref{sec:exploration}) leads us to
choose \emph{venue} as the elementary unit of information. Therefore, we
represent them by some numerical features (\autoref{sec:feature}) in the rest
of this work. Beside raw data, we also gathered ground truth by conducting a
small-scale user study (\autoref{sec:user-study}). Finally, as we are problem
and not data-driven, we conclude this chapter by assessing the adequacy of such
data toward our goal, and by presenting alternative sources of information
(\autoref{sec:limitations}).

To limit the scope of our study, we focus on 20 cities:
\begin{itemize}
	\item 10 located in the United States: Atlanta, Chicago, Houston,
		Indianapolis, Los Angeles, New York, Saint Louis, San Francisco,
		Seattle and Washington
	\item 10 located in Europe: Amsterdam, Barcelona, Berlin, Helsinki, London,
		Moscow, Paris, Prague, Rome and Stockholm
\end{itemize}

They were chosen for their high activity according to
\href{http://www.4sqstat.com/}{4sqstat.com}. We deliberately exclude other
parts of the world as we are not familiar enough with them to correctly
evaluate our results.
