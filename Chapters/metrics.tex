\chapter{Choice of metrics}
\label{chap:metric}

In this chapter, we describe the various metrics we considered for measuring
similarity between venues (\autoref{sec:venues-metrics}) and neighborhoods
(\autoref{sec:regions-metrics}). We also present what evaluation strategy we
devised to choose between several candidates and the final results we obtained.

\section{Venues metrics}
\label{sec:venues-metrics}

As exposed in Objective \ref{objective:venue-distance-learning}, we want a
distance function between two venues, where venues are points in the feature
space described in \autoref{tab:venuefeatures} \vpageref{tab:venuefeatures}.

We evaluate a number of different approaches:
\begin{itemize}
	\item
		information theoretic metric learning (\itml);
	\item
		gradient boosted large margin nearest neighbor (\lmnn);
	\item
		embedding to a 2-$d$ plane via $t$-distributed stochastic neighbor
		embedding (\tsne) dimensionality reduction method, and computing the
		Euclidean distance on the projected space; 
	\item 
		Euclidean distance in the original space (\eucl).
\end{itemize}		

We described the theory of the first two in \autoref{sub:metric-learning} but
let us provide practical details on how the learning was done in our specific
setting. Because these methods are semi supervised, we need some labeling of
venues, indicating their similarity. But there is no such labeling easily
available. Therefore, we rely on Foursquare top-level category as a proxy,
which defines 9 classes. This is problematic for two reasons. First, these
categories are so broad that two \emph{Food} venues may not have much in
common. Second, the labeling can be noisy: for instance, imagine a museum that
most people visit mostly for its cafeteria, and thus it is closer to
restaurants than other museums.  However, considering the large volume of
venues over many cities and with different types, we expect the signal to be
stronger than the noise, and the learning algorithms to yield a robust
estimation. 

Note also that generally, \tsne{} is not considered as a metric learning method
per se. Yet we already argued that it can learn to uncover relationships between
points based on their position in the high-dimensional space. Furthermore, we
were struck by the experimental result showed in \autoref{fig:tsne}. When we hide
category information, venues of the same category are still projected in the
same part of the space. Thus, we expect the proximity of venues in this
plane to be a good measure of their overall similarity.

\begin{figure}[htpb]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{tsne}
	\caption[2D projection of European venues by t-SNE]{Using code from
		\cite{BarnesHut13}, we compute the 2D embedding of 23086 venues from 10 cities in
		Europe. By taking into account all the 31 features but the category of each
		venue, the method is able to roughly group venues of the same kind: Education
		on the right, Nightlife on the bottom left, Professional on the bottom right
	or Recreation on the top. \label{fig:tsne}}
\end{figure}

% As well as two baselines:
% \begin{itemize}
% 	\item $d_A$ where $A$ is a diagonal matrix with random coefficients in
% 		the range $[2, 20]$.
% 	\item Random ordering of venues. It is not a metric but because we
% 		only evaluate ranking instead of distances themselves that is
% 		enough.
% \end{itemize}		
As mentioned, there is no similarity ground truth so we evaluate how well these
metrics perform on the following tasks:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item finding venues of the same brand in another city.
	\item finding venues of the same category in another city.
\end{enumerate}		

\subsection{Brand finding}
\label{sub:brand_finding}

For this first task, we start by looking at common substrings in the name of
venues, keeping those that were company name and not mere generic terms like
\emph{park} or \emph{hotel}. We selected \emph{Starbucks} and \emph{McDonald's}
as they are ubiquitous and unambiguous.


For each venue \venue\ of one of these two brands in one city $\city$, we rank
all venues in another city $\city'$ based on their distance to~\venue, and
consider the highest ranked venue of the same brand.  The smaller the rank of
this first match, the better the distance measure under consideration.  The
results for McDonald's are shown in \autoref{tab:metric_brand_first}.  \lmnn\ is
the best suited measure, even though \eucl, without any training, is often close,
contrary to \tsne, which is clearly not up to the task.

\end{table}

Another way to evaluate these measures is to look at the first 540 venues
retrieved, and given $k$, count how many of them before rank $k$ are of this
brand (precision) and what proportion of all branded venues are recovered
(recall). The average $F_1$-score is then given in
\autoref{tab:metric_brand_f1} for $k \in \{15, 50, 200\}$ and \lmnn\ again
outperforms other measures.

\subsection{Category ordering}
\label{sub:category_ordering}


The second task is more general. Each venue is assigned a hierarchical category
by Foursquare\footnote{The complete tree can be seen on their website:
\href{https://developer.foursquare.com/categorytree}{%
\url{developer.foursquare.com/categorytree}}.}. We restrict ourselves to two
levels, meaning that one venue can be a \emph{French Restaurant $\rightarrow$
Food} and another one an \emph{Airport $\rightarrow$ Travel \& Transport}. We
repeat the same sorting procedure but this time, we expect venues of the
same sub category to be first, followed by other venues of the same top
category and then the rest. To measure how well metrics achieved such
ranking, we use \methodname{Normalised Discounted Cumulative Gain}
\autocite{IREvaluation07}. The gain is a measure of relevance. We
arbitrarily choose $rel_i=1$ when the sub category of two venues matches,
$rel_i=0.4$ when only top category matches and $rel_i=0$ if they were not
related at all. We accumulate them (or sum them) but discount results that
came too late with \[ \mathrm{DCG} = \sum_{i=1} \frac{ 2^{rel_{i}} - 1 }{
\log_{2}(i+1)} \] Finally, we normalized by the result of a perfect ordering
to have scores between $0$ and $1$, which allow direct comparison.  The
results, shown in \autoref{tab:metric_type}, confirm that \lmnn\ and \eucl\
are the best measures regarding this task.  It is noteworthy that \eucl\
performs so well without any training.

\end{table}


\section{Neighborhoods metrics}
\label{sec:regions-metrics}


We proceed with addressing
Objective~\ref{objective:neighborhood-distance-learning}, that is, selecting a
distance measure between sets of feature vectors, in order to evaluate
similarity between city neighborhoods.  We consider the following options.

\subsection{Candidates}

\paragraph{Earth mover's distance}
To compute \emd\ we assume an underlying metric to measure
distances between vectors.
We experiment with three variants of \emd:
($i$) using as the underlying metric the Euclidean distance (\emde); 
($ii$) using as the underlying metric the distance learned with \lmnn\ (\emdl); 
($iii$) using as the underlying metric the Euclidean distance and
requiring only a certain fraction of the total mass to be moved
(\emdp).
The rationale of \emdp\ is to provide more flexibility by allowing for two
neighborhoods to have a fraction of venues that are completely different.  For
the fraction of the mass required to move, we used 80\% in our experiments.
Specifically, if we have distribution $P$ and $Q$ with weights $w_P$ and $w_Q$
summing to one and a ground metric $d$ between them, we find the flow $f$
solving:
\begin{align*}
	&\quad \underset{f}{\min} \sum_{i,j} d_{i,j} f_{i,j} \\
	\text{subject to} &\quad \sum_j f_{i,j} \leq w_{P,i} \\
	&\quad \sum_i f_{i,j} \leq w_{Q,j} \\
	&\quad \sum_{i,j} f_{i,j} \geq 0.8 
\end{align*}

\paragraph{Jensen--Shannon divergence}
\jsd\ can be computed for multivariate distributions, 
however, in our setting we have a relatively small number of samples
(a typical neighborhood contains around~100 venues, and never more
than~700) and a large number of dimensions ($30$ features, see 
\autoref{sec:feature}), 
so we cannot estimate an accurate joint probability distribution.
There are some workarounds \autocite{EstimateKL07} but instead,
we opt for computing the \jsd\ independently for each feature, whose density
was estimated with a simple 10-bins histogram. 
In particular, we compute
$\mathrm{\jsd}_1(F^{(i)},G^{(i)})$,  
where  
$\mathrm{\jsd}_1$ is univariate \jsd, while 
$F^{(i)}$ and $G^{(i)}$ are the distributions of the $i$\textsuperscript{th} feature for
the vector sets $F$ and $G$, respectively.
We then aggregate over all features by
\begin{equation}
\label{equation:jsd}
\mathrm{\jsd}(F,G) = 
\sum_{i} \theta_i \cdot\mathrm{\jsd}_1(F^{(i)},G^{(i)}).
\end{equation}
We learn the values of the coefficients $\theta_i$ using our collected
ground-truth data (described in \autoref{sec:user-study}). We consider all
pairs of neighborhoods obtained and label them as similar if they refer to the
same district in Paris (showed in \autoref{tab:district}
\pageref{tab:district}). We then compute $\theta_i$ to maximize the sum of the
\jsd\ values over similar pairs minus the sum of \jsd\ values over non similar
pairs, subject to the normalization constraint $\sum_i |\theta_i| =1$.

\paragraph{Minimum cost matching distance}
A very simple way to compute a distance between two sets of feature vectors is
to compute the \emph{centroid} of each set and then compute the distance
between the two centroids.  We extend this simple definition with $k$
centroids.  Given a set of feature vectors, we perform $k$-means clustering,
and represent the set with $k$ centroids.  Then, given two sets of feature
vectors, and their corresponding $k$-set centroids, we compute the distance of
a min-cost matching, using the Hungarian algorithm.  We experiment with
different values of~$k$ and here we report the best results, obtained
for~$k=3$.

\bigskip

All these methods can accept weighted input. We consider using number of unique
visitors and thus paying more attention to popular venues but it did not
perform better.

\subsection{Evaluation}
\label{sub:region-evaluation}

\subsubsection{Methodology}
We now describe our evaluation process for selecting the best function for
measuring distance over feature vector sets. 
Consider a neighborhood \region\ in a source city \city, and a target city
$\city'$.
From our user study, we know $k$ ground-truth neighborhoods
$\region_1,\ldots,\region_k$ in $\city'$, which are the most 
similar to~\region.

Given a distance measure $\rdist$ we want to evaluate, 
we can then compute the distance
$\rdist(\vfvs(\region),\vfvs(\region'))$ for each possible
neighborhood $\region'$ of $\city'$ and rank all those neighborhoods
in order of increasing distance. 
We can evaluate the quality of this ranking by checking the position
that the ground-truth neighborhoods $\region_1,\ldots,\region_k$
appear in the ranking---if appearing at all. 
The higher we find a match, the better the ranking, and thus, the
better the distance measure~$\rdist$.

Since we do not have any a-priori neighborhood boundaries (and in fact
we do not want to use any, since a neighborhood may be defined dynamically,
different from what administrative boundaries would give),
any subset of venues that corresponds to a closed and connected region
is a candidate neighborhood. 
As there are exponentially many such subsets, we restrict our
search to regions of a certain shape. 
We consider neighborhoods $\region'$ to be \emph{circles}
$(\venue',\radius)$, centered at a venue $\venue'$ and with radius~\radius.
We take as $\venue'$ regularly spaced venues in $\city'$ and $\radius\in\{200, 275,
350, 425, 500\}$ meters, with the additional constraint that the
resulting circle should contain at least 20 venues. 
After ranking all possible such circular neighborhoods $\region'$ in
order of increasing distance $\rdist(\vfvs(\region),\vfvs(\region'))$
we remove overlapping neighborhoods.

To evaluate the resulting ranking, we need a 
\emph{relevance score} for each neighborhood $\region'$ in the ranking
with respect to the ground-truth neighborhoods
$\region_1,\ldots,\region_k$. 
Note that $\region'$ may not be identical to any of the ground-truth
neighbor\-hoods (for one, $\region'$ is circular, while the ground-truth
neighbor\-hoods can have arbitrary shapes) but there may have
significant overlap with some of them. 
To account for such overlap, we define the relevance of each
$\region'$ to be
\[
\rel(\region' \mid \region_1,\ldots,\region_k) =
\max_{i=1}^{k}
\frac{|\venues(\region')\cap\venues(\region_i)|} {|\venues(\region')\cup\venues(\region_i)|},
\]
that is, the best \emph{overlap} of $\region'$ with a 
ground-truth neighborhood $\region_1,\ldots,\region_k$, 
where the overlap is measured using the \emph{Jaccard coefficient} 
on the sets of venues of two neighborhoods.

Having assigned a relevance score for each neighborhood $\region'$ in
the ranking, we evaluate the quality of the ranking using 
\emph{discounted cumulative gain} (\dcg) on the first five candidates.

\subsubsection{Results}
Starting with each of the 6 cities as a source city and for each of the 8 query
neighborhoods,  we compute the most similar neighborhoods in all other cities,
using each of the distance measures that we want to evaluate.  The results are
shown in \autoref{tab:distance-comparisons}.  Each row corresponds to a source
city.  \dcg\ scores are averaged over all target cities and all 8 query
neighborhoods.

		are issued from the city on the left. The best metric in each city is

\end{table}

We see that \emde\ is the best-performing measure, while \jsd\ performs rather
poorly.  \emdl\ performs only slightly worse than \emde.  One should contrast
this with the results of the previous section, where \lmnn\ slightly
outperformed \eucl\ for the task of finding the most similar venue.  Thus our
results indicate that the nature of the similarity-search task is important for
the choice of the distance measure.

Another observation is that the absolute \dcg\ scores of all measures are
relatively low.  One reason is that many neighborhoods in the ground truth have
non-circular shapes (e.g., a long street of luxurious shops).  Thus, even if
our measures discover an area very close to the ground truth, due to its
circular shape, it can have low overlap with the ground truth, and low
relevance score. A second unfavorable situation happens when the ground truth
contains only one or two small regions. Because we try to find them with five
disjoint circles, it must be the case that some these circles have no overlap
at all with ground truth and thus have a relevance of 0.  Yet this is merely a
comment rather than an issue as here, we are concerned by comparing measures
and they all suffer from this fact in the same way.
