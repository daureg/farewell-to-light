\section{Problem definition}
\label{sec:problem}

Let us define formally this problem. We have a set of cities $\mathcal{C} =
\{c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_n\}$, each of them defined by a enclosing rectangle
$R_{c_i} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$. Furthermore, each city $c_i$ contains a
subset $V_{c_i} \subseteq \mathcal{V}$, where $\mathcal{V}$ is a set of
\emph{venues}. A \emph{venue} is an uniquely identified location that can be
visited by individuals. It includes for instance restaurants, shops, airports,
monuments and parks. Finally, each city $c_i$ is described by another subset
$I_{c_i} \subseteq \mathcal{I}$, where $\mathcal{I}$ is a set of \emph{items}.
These \emph{items} are user contributed discrete points in space and time
that can have additional attributes. Here, we exploit Flickr photos (with
tags) and Foursquare check-ins as type of item\footnote{But it should be
	possible to extend this definition to other kind of data. For
	instance, a tweet can be seen as point in time and space (along with
	the sentiment it conveys). Or we can consider noise and pollution
	measurements, the number of cars in a given intersection during a one
	minute window, Yelp reviews, etc. Stretching the concept, we may even
	imagine gathering anonymized customer receipts from grocery shops.
	The payload could then be the proportion in which different kind of
	goods are consumed. Indeed, even for two shops of the same company in
the same city, it would give information about the neighboring population.}.
Items are associated with venues, either directly, like check-ins, or
indirectly, like photos. In the latter case, the relationship between venues
and items is based on spatial distance for instance.

By combining venues own characteristics and their associated items, we want to
devise a similarity measure over the venues $\mathcal{V}$, namely $s:
\mathcal{V}^2 \rightarrow \llbracket 0, 1 \rrbracket $. This provides a
building block for another measure of similarity between two spatial regions.
More precisely, after choosing a home city $c_h$ and a target city
$c_t$\footnote{$t$ can also stand for travel or tourist.}, we want to
construct $s': R_{c_h} \times R_{c_t} \rightarrow \llbracket 0, 1 \rrbracket$.
These two functions answer the following queries:

\begin{enumerate}
\item When users pick a venue $v$ in their home city, find the venue in the
	target town that is the most similar to it. Formally, we compute
	$\argmax_{v' \in V_{c_t}} s(v, v')$.\label{q:point}
\item Instead of a single venue, users ask for a larger area $r$, for instance
	covering a neighborhood\footnote{or any other meaningful subdivision.}
	from their home city. In that case we also return an area:
	$\argmax_{r' \subseteq V_{c_t}} s'(r, r')$.\label{q:space}
\end{enumerate}
