\chapter{Dataset}
\label{chap:dataset}

There are many ways to obtain information about places. The most
straightforward is to ask directly people. For instance, \textcite{Curated14}
\marginpar{describe better} asked residents of Pittsburgh to build a city
guide by sharing their opinion about locations they know well.
Mine text, like yelp review \autocite{YelpReview14}
Image analysis to describe place atmosphere
Transportation data to see which place are connected

In this work, we choose to focus on trace of human activity. Namely we
collected Foursquare check-ins and Flickr photos' metadata. The first step of
this process was to choose a fixed number of cities.

According to \href{http://www.4sqstat.com/}{4sqstat.com}, we first selected
the ten cities in the US with the highest number of check-ins: New York,
Washington, San Francisco, Atlanta, Indianapolis, Los Angeles, Seattle,
Houston, St. Louis and Chicago. We did something similar in Europe,
resulting in the selection of London, Paris, Berlin, Rome, Prague, Moscow,
Amsterdam, Helsinki, Stockholm and Barcelona. This is admittedly a choice
biased by our own history and the ease to gather user input. Indeed, Rio
de Janeiro or Tokyo are more active than Helsinki or Stockholm, but less
familiar to us and to many students of Aalto University, making results more
difficult to interpret.

Besides their own issues explained later, these two datasets suffers from
biased user distribution\autocite{Weird10}, heavy tail (half of twitter users
have never tweeted \href{http://twopcharts.com/twitteractivitymonitor}%

\section{Foursquare}

Why people use 4SQ\autocite{FSMotivation11}.

\subsection{Check-ins}

Foursquare check-ins are not available publicly for free, thus one has to
find other way to get them. The easiest one was to reuse an existing dataset.
Between September 2010 and January 2011, \textcite{dataset11} collected
\numprint{22387930} check-ins  from various LBSN.

A typical check-in looks like this:
\begin{verbatim}
41418752    19459464870    38.931834    -77.028256
2010-07-25 01:19:02    a95cd7e5e0eddaad
I'm at Meridian Pint (, ) w/ 7 others. http://4sq.com/9GoW57
\end{verbatim}

where we can find the twitter user id, the tweet id, the
latitude and longitude, the local time, a place id and the tweet's text
\footnote{a more thorough description can be found online
at \href{http://infolab.tamu.edu/static/users/zhiyuan/icwsm\_2011\_readme.pdf}%
{\url{http://infolab.tamu.edu/static/users/zhiyuan/icwsm\_2011\_readme.pdf}}.}.

After filtering tweets originating from our twenty cities, we were left with
\numprint{2133752} of them. However, there is no easy way to map twitter place
id to Foursquare venue id\footnote{It even seems that there is not one to one
correspondence between them.}. Therefore, we had to follow the short links
appearing in the tweets to recover those ids. But as the dataset is rather old,
some links are dead. At the end, we found \numprint{1296505} exploitable
check-ins, as showed in \autoref{tab:dataset}.

\medskip

Another way to access check-ins is to use Twitter. Some applications publish
tweets regarding check-in on the behalf of user. Furthermore, Twitter allows
anyone to access a small sample of public tweets\footnote{Using their Public
    streams API described here:
    \href{https://dev.twitter.com/docs/streaming-apis/streams/public}%
{\url{https://dev.twitter.com/docs/streaming-apis/streams/public}}.}.
\marginpar{refactor script to clean dependencies} Therefore we set up our own
collection process from March to July 2014\footnote{The code can be found on
    github: \href{https://github.com/daureg/illalla}%
{\url{https://github.com/daureg/illalla}}.} by selecting tweets with
\url{4sq.com} links, retaining those located in the target cities and that
leads to real check-ins. It adds \numprint{351365} tweets. The format,
described in \autoref{tab:checkinfields}, is rather similar to the previous
one:

\subsection{Venues}

Each of these check-ins is associated with a venue. Thus, the second part of
the collection process was to gather information about all of those
\numprint{226768} that appear in at least on check-in. This was done by calling the
appropriate Foursquare API, with result showed in \autoref{tab:venue}.

\subsection{Limitations}

\autocite{ValidateCheckin13,FindingFake14}

bias in twitter sampling\autocite{TwitterBias14}

situation where people are reluctant to check-in\autocite{Privacy11}

fixed categories instead of inferred LDA semantics\autocite{PlaceSemantic14}

\section{Flickr}

Using the Flickr API, we downloaded metadata\footnote{But no image at all.}
from every photo satisfying a set of criteria: they contained at least one
tag, they were located inside one of the chosen city and they have been
uploaded after January 1\textsuperscript{st}, 2008. This yields
\numprint{7748621} photos but as showed in \autoref{tab:dataset}, there are a
factor of 77 between figures in New-York and Helsinki.

More precisely, in addition to tags and location, we know when each photos was
taken and uploaded, by which user and what title was given to it (the title
was not used except when it contained hashtags, which were converted to tags).
Thus a typical data point looks like what is described in \autoref{tab:photo}.

\subsection{Limitations}

This retrieval process was naturally not perfect. In addition to some API
calls returning strange results, the casual nature of the data explains their
inherent noise.

\begin{itemize}
	\item While timestamp issued by mobile phones are likely to be correct,
 as their internal clock is synchronized by internet, this may not
 always be the case for dedicated cameras. More concerning than usual
 drift of low quality clock is the situation of tourists coming from
 different timezone. Yet as I could not think of any simple solution to
 that problem, I just ignored it and carried on.
	\item To ensure the quality of the localization, I restricted myself to
 photos whose precision is deemed \enquote{street level} by Flickr. The
 potential problem is that it would cost an extra request to know
 whether this location was given by GPS (in which case the camera
 position is accurate) or by the user at upload time. In the latter
 case, in addition to the general imprecision of the method, it is
 ambiguous whether this location refer the place where the photo was
 shot or the position of the photo's subject\footnote{Think of a bridge
 taken from a nearby hill.}.
	\item Finally, without additional request, the tags obtained are those
 normalized by Flickr. This normalization is not bijective but it is
 assumed that two tags with the same normalized form were close in the
 first place.
\end{itemize}

\section{Human input}

By its nature, the problem is intrinsically unsupervised, for we do not know
before hand which place is similar to which one. Furthermore, there is no
easily available source containing this information at a large scale. The
traditional approach in recommendation system is to held off the most recent
data and compare the predicted result with them to assess its accuracy.  Yet
in this case, this method do not work. Firstly because it restricts test users
to those that have spend a significant time in several cities. Secondly, even
among this limited pool, there would still not be enough information to
judge similarity. Consider someone who visited ten restaurants in Paris in
2010 and fifteen in London in 2012. We cannot infer from that that they are
all similar to each other, which mean we are still facing the original issue,
albeit at a smaller scale\footnote{A scale that potentially let us do manual
labeling though.}.

To overcome this difficulty of evaluating results, we decided to ask people
for their opinion. But as we thought it was to convoluted to ask directly for
pair of locations, we adopted a simpler approach. We presented user with a
list of activities (the full list is presented in \autoref{tab:questions}) and
a map of a city. For each activity, user are prompted to draw region on the
map and optionally, select specific venues. The interface is showed in
\autoref{fig:survey}.
