\section{Flickr}
\label{sec:flickr}

\flickr{} is a popular photo sharing service that, as of 2014, has tens of
millions of users. It enables users to upload, store, and share their photos,
publicly or with their friends. Moreover, it allows users to geo-locate their
photos and tag them with descriptive keywords. 

Using the Flickr API, we downloaded meta-data from every photo satisfying a set
of criteria: they contained at least one tag, they were located inside one of
the chosen city and they have been uploaded after January
1\textsuperscript{st}, 2008. This yields \numprint{8358327} photos but as
showed in \autoref{tab:dataset}, there is a factor of 62 between the figures in
New-York and Helsinki.

More precisely, in addition to tags and location, we know when each photo was
taken and uploaded, by which user and what title was given to it (the title
was not used except when it contained hashtags, which were converted to tags).
Thus a typical data point looks like what is described in \autoref{tab:photo}
\pageref{tab:photo}.

Because of their casual nature, the data contains some inherent noise:
\begin{itemize}
	\item While timestamp issued by mobile phones are likely to be correct,
 as their internal clock is synchronized by internet, this may not
 always be the case for dedicated cameras. More concerning than the usual
 drift of low quality clocks is the situation of tourists coming from
 different timezone. Yet as we could not think of any simple solution to
 that problem, we just ignored it and carried on.
	\item To ensure the quality of the localization, we restricted results to
 photos whose precision is deemed \enquote{street level} by Flickr. The
 problem is that it would cost an extra request to know
 whether this location was given by GPS (in which case the camera
 position is accurate) or by the user at upload time. In the latter
 case, in addition to the general imprecision of the method, it is
 ambiguous whether this location refers to the place where the photo was
 shot or the position of the photo's subject\footnote{Think of a bridge
 taken from a nearby hill.}.
\end{itemize}
