Building upon the insights gained by exploring the dataset, we settle to
represents each venues by the numeric vector presented in
\autoref{tab:venuefeatures} \vpageref{tab:venuefeatures}. The features involving the surrounding (numbered
from 6 to 16 and 25 to 30) were weighted by a 2D Gaussian of radius $r=350$
meters.
